Inorganic chemistry is a division of chemistry that studies metals,
their compounds, and their reactivity.  Metal atoms can be bound to
other metal atoms in alloys or metal clusters, to nonmetal elements in
crystalline rocks, or to small organic molecules, such as a
cyclopentadienyl anion in ferrocene.  These metal atoms can also be part
of large biological molecules, as in the case of iron in hemoglobin
(oxygen-carrier protein in the blood). In this course, you should not
think of metals as you encounter them in your daily life (i.e., when you
pick up a steel knife, a can of soda, or a gold necklace).  Instead, you
should think of a metal as the central atom or ion in a molecule
surrounded by other ions or small molecules called *ligands*.  Depending
on what these ligands are, the metal-containing compound can acquire
very different physical and chemical properties.  For example, when
magnesium (in its ionic state) is bound to carbonate ions, it forms
solid crystalline rocks, as in the dolomite rocks (calcium/magnesium
carbonates).  When Mg<sup>2+</sup> is bound to a porphyrin molecule, it
forms the active site of chlorophyll, the pigment that plants use to
absorb the sunlight necessary to produce carbohydrates from water and
carbon dioxide.  Moreover, when magnesium is bound to a carbon fragment
and a bromide, it forms the Grignard reagent, which is an important
reagent used in organic synthesis.  Ligands are critical in determining
the overall chemical/physical properties and functions of the
metal-containing molecule.  Inorganic chemistry often includes the study
of metalloids—such elements as silicon and germanium, which are
extremely important in the semiconductor industry.  In fact, a silicon
chip is probably at the base of every commonplace electric device. This
course will begin with a review of the important topics learned in
general chemistry, such as atomic structures and trends in the periodic
table.  Then, this course will move into an in-depth discussion of
coordination compounds, solid state chemistry, and inorganic acids and
bases.  We will also learn about the structure of ionic solids and
crystalline compounds.  The last unit of this course will discuss the
chemistry and reactivity of the elements in Groups 1–7 of the periodic
table.  This course will also enable you to understand the role of metal
compounds in important industrial applications (such as catalysis) as
well as in biological activities (such as oxygen transportation via
molecules in the blood or enzymatic activity).  You will learn about
these applications in advanced inorganic chemistry and/or bioinorganic
chemistry.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Describe nuclear charge and calculate effective nuclear charge in
    terms of Slater’s rules.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of trends in the periodic table.
-   Describe the bonding between atoms in terms of valence bond theory.
-   Describe inorganic structures by using valence shell electron pair
    repulsion theory.
-   Identify the nomenclature rules of coordination compounds.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of crystal structures, lattice
    energies, and different types of unit cells.
-   Explain the electronic structure of solids, the concept of band gap
    energy, and how this band gap determines the electronic properties
    (insulator, conductor, and semiconductor) of solid materials.
-   Describe general trends in the reactivity of elements within Groups
    I through VII.
