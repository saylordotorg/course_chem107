**Unit 7: Groups 1–7 of the Periodic Table** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look at the properties of the elements in Groups
1–7 of the periodic table.  We will also discuss organometallic
compounds of the elements within each respective group.  Remember that
organometallics is the study of metals bonded to nonmetals.  In organic
chemistry, we have seen organometallic reagents in the form of Grignard
reagents, metal hydrides, etc.  *

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 15 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 2 hours

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Identify the elements of the Groups 1–7 metals.
-   Describe the synthesis and reactivity of compounds of the Groups 1–7
    metals.
