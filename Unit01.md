**Unit 1: Introduction to Inorganic Chemistry** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn the different parts of a hydrogen atom
wavefunction and discover how wavefunctions relate to atomic orbitals
and their relative energies.  You will also learn how to determine the
atomic term symbols from a given electronic configuration and use Hund’s
rules to predict the electronic ground state.  This unit ends with a
comprehensive analysis of trends in the periodic table.  You will learn
how to rationalize the exceptions in these periodic trends.  *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 6 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 1 hour

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Use wave numbers to describe the shapes of orbitals.
-   Identify the electron configuration for a given element.
-   Explain the concepts of orbital penetration and shielding.
-   Predict the properties of elements based on their positions on the
    periodic table.
