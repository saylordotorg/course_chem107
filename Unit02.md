**Unit 2: Complex Ions and Coordination Compounds** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will teach you the strengths and weaknesses of valence bond
theory, crystal field theory, and molecular orbital theory in describing
the bonding in coordination compounds and metal complex ions.  In the
process of discussing these theories, you will learn why certain complex
ions have certain colors.  The molecular orbital theory can explain why
metal carbonyl compounds, such as [Co(CO)<sub>6</sub>], are often
colorless, whereas halogen ligands often form complexes that are
brightly colored, such as fluoride ions in the cobalt complex
[CoF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>.*
