**Unit 4: Ionic Solids** <span id="4"></span> 
*Ionic solids take on specific three-dimensional structures based on the
size of the atoms.  In this unit, we will see the similarities and
differences between these structures.  We will first look at the unit
cell and then transition into more complex packing patterns.  *

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 1 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 1 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.4: 1 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Determine the nature of cubic and hexagonal crystal lattices.
-   Differentiate between body- and face-centered unit cells.
-   Differentiate between tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial holes.
-   Examine the effect of metal radii on the nature of the structure of
    alloys.
