**Unit 3: Bonding in Crystal Solids** <span id="3"></span> 
*Molecules that consist of charged ions with opposite charges are called
“ionic.” These ionic compounds are generally solids with high melting
points whose solutions conduct electrical current.  Ionic compounds are
generally formed from metals and nonmetal elements.  The strength of
chemical bonds you have encountered so far—mostly in organic
chemistry—can be easily estimated by taking a look at the atoms
involved.  For example, an isolated C=C has a bond energy of 614
KJ/mol.  In crystal solids, the strength of the ionic bonds is much more
complex to evaluate than in organic molecules because many parameters,
such as the charge, the size of its ions, and the geometry of the
crystal need to be taken into consideration.  This ionic bond energy is
known as “lattice energy.” You will learn how to calculate the lattice
energy in this unit.*
