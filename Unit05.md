**Unit 5: Solid State Chemistry** <span id="5"></span> 
*Solid state chemistry studies the behavior of a very large aggregation
of atoms that form crystals and solid networks.  Recall from molecular
orbital theory that electrons in a molecule populate distinct orbitals
located at distinct energy levels.  Electrons populate the low-energy
orbitals first.  These electrons can be excited into high-energy
orbitals by heat or absorption of light.  In large aggregations of
atoms, such as in a solid network, low-energy orbitals are so close (in
terms of energy levels) and numerous that they form a continuous band of
orbitals.  Electrons can easily move from one orbital to another within
this band.  In solid networks, the majority of the electrons populate a
single band (known as the valence band), which is the equivalent of all
the low-energy orbitals of molecules.  As electrons in single molecules
can be excited into higher-energy orbitals, electrons in the valence
band can be excited into the high energy band (called the conductive
band).  The difference in energy between the valence and conductive band
is called “band gap energy”; different materials can have very different
band gap energies.  You must understand how the band gap is formed and
how electrons can move from one band to another in order to comprehend
such properties as electrical conductivity and heat conduction in
materials.*
