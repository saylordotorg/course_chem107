**Unit 6: Acids and Bases** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the acids and bases of inorganic metals and
nonmetals.  The concept of an acid as an electron acceptor and a base as
an electron donor would greatly expand the number of compounds
considered acidic or basic.  We will also review classical acids and
bases, such as the Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases.  We
will in turn study the Lewis concept of acids and bases and introduce a
new approach to understanding acidity and basicity, whereby acids and
bases are defined as “hard” and “soft” (the hard/soft acid/base [HSAB]
theory) based on their size, charge density, and polarizability.  We
will also discuss the use of activity as a measure for the concentration
of a solution, the acids of metal oxoacids (e.g., chromic acid), and the
amphoteric behavior of certain chemical compounds (compounds that can be
acids and bases).*
